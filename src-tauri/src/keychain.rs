//! The macOS Keychain: Humla's one service, and the cache in front of it.
//!
//! Every secret Humla keeps — each provider's API key, the webhook endpoint
//! (#213), the cloud credentials — is an account under [`SERVICE`]. Reads go
//! through [`Cache`] so a session prompts the Keychain at most once per
//! account: without it, a signed build whose ACL the user hasn't trusted yet
//! would prompt on every read.
//!
//! Keyed by Keychain account rather than by whatever names the secret, so two
//! callers can't cache one account under two keys and disagree after a write.
